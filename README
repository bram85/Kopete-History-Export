KopeteHistoryExport README

============
Introduction
============

First of all, thank you for using the Kopete Export stylesheets. With these
stylesheets you can export your Kopete History to a plain text file or export to
HTML. First off, I'll show you how to convert a history file. Then I'll discuss
the optional parameters you can pass to xsltproc in order to adjust the output.
After that, I'll list the ids and classes which are used in the HTML export such
that you can adjust the styles of the elements in the HTML export.

==========
How to use
==========

To export a history XML file to plain text:

  xsltproc -o johnsmith-200706.txt kopetehistory2text.xsl
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/kopete/logs/MSNProtocol/mycontact@example.org/johnsmith-
200706.xml

The resulting file is already formatted and shouldn't require any further
adjustments.

Similary, in order to export a history XML file to HTML:

  xsltproc -o johnsmith-200706.html kopetehistory2html.xsl \
  $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kopete/logs/MSNProtocol/mycontact@example.org/johnsmith-200706.xml

The resulting HTML is quite basic, but it refers to a CSS Stylesheet with the
file name 'style.css' in order to tune the output how you'd like it.

It is possible to pass extra parameters to xsltproc in order to adjust the
output. These parameters are discussed in the sections below. But to pass an
parameter, run:

  xsltproc -stringparam day 1 -o johnsmith-200706.txt kopetehistory2text.xsl \
  $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kopete/logs/MSNProtocol/mycontact@example.org/johnsmith-200706.xml

So that is: -stringparam , followed by the parameter name, followed by the
parameter value.

==========
Parameters
==========

The following parameters can be passed to either stylesheet:

* day         [INT] Select which days you want in the output (days of month,
              separated by a non space character). By default, all days
              are exported.
* shortnicks  ('yes'|'no') Show short nicks. The name is truncated from the
              first space in the nick name. Default is 'no'.
* shownicks   ('yes'|'no')
              Show the nick names of the persons. Default is 'yes'.
              If set to 'no', names like <<< or >>> are being used. This may be
              confusing with conversation with more than two persons.
* showtime    ('yes'|'no') Show the time of the day in advance of each message.
              Default is 'yes'.

================================
HTML export: CSS IDs and classes
================================

The following ids are being used:

  title           The title of the page.
  messagetable    The style which should apply to the complete table: all days
                  and its messages.

The following classes are being used:

  cell            Applies to all cells in the table.
  daterow         Applies to the rows which are used to indicate the date.
  messagerow      Applies to the rows which are used to show messages
                  (time+nick+message).
  datecell        The cell inside a daterow indicating the date.
  timecell        Part of a messagerow: the cell with the time of the day of
                  the message.
  nickcell        Part of a messagerow: the cell with the nickname belonging
                  to a message.
  messagecell     Part of a messagerow: the cell with the message itself.
  contactXrow     A row which belongs a contact in the conversation. The X is
                  replaced by 1,2,...,N in a conversation with N contacts.
  oddmessagerow   An odd message row.
  evenmessagerow  An even message row.
